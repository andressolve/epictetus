                <p>They left the school and crossed the square toward the craftsmen's quarter. Nikos walked quickly, then had to slow down to match the old man's pace. He felt irritated by this. He felt irritated by everything.</p>

                <p>They arrived at a sculptor's workshop—an open-air space with a canvas shade stretched over it, surrounded by blocks of stone in various states. Some were rough, fresh from the quarry. Others had been partially carved. One, near the back, was nearly finished: a young athlete, mid-stride, frozen in marble.</p>
                <p>The sculptor was an older man named Demetrios. His arms were thick with muscle, his hands white with dust. He was working on a new piece—a block of grayish stone shot through with dark veins.</p>

                <p>"A student. Nikos, this is Demetrios. He's been cutting stone for forty years."</p>
                <p>Nikos nodded, distracted. His eyes were on the rough block. It looked wrong somehow. Flawed.</p>
                <p>"That's an ugly piece of marble," Nikos said.</p>
                <p>Demetrios laughed. "It is. Full of cracks. Hard veins. The quarry master apologized when he delivered it. Said it was the best he had this month."</p>

                <h1>Difficult Stone</h1>
                <p>"Why work with it at all?" Nikos asked. "Why not wait for better stone?"</p>
                <p>"Because someone commissioned a statue. And this is the stone I have." Demetrios ran his hand along a dark vein in the marble. "A better sculptor than me might refuse it. But I've learned something over the years: difficult stone demands your full attention. You can't be careless with it. You can't rush."</p>
                <p>He picked up his chisel and positioned it carefully against the block.</p>
                <p>"With easy stone, you can get away with sloppy strikes. The marble forgives you. But this?" He tapped the dark vein. "One careless blow and the whole thing cracks. I have to think about every single cut."</p>

                <p>Demetrios struck the chisel. A small chip flew off. He examined the result, adjusted his angle, struck again.</p>
                <p>Nikos watched. Despite himself, he was interested.</p>
                <p>"What happens if you hit it wrong?"</p>
                <p>Demetrios gestured toward a corner of the workshop. There, half-hidden under a cloth, was a cracked block of marble. The crack ran right through what would have been the figure's torso.</p>
                <p>"That happens. Three weeks of work. Gone."</p>

                <p>Nikos was quiet.</p>
                <p>"So now I start over. New block. Same commission. Except now I'm behind schedule and the client is annoyed." Demetrios smiled grimly. "The careless blow cost me more than the careful one would have."</p>

                <p>"I want to be clear about something," Epictetus said. "I'm not saying your life has been easy. I know something of your history. Your father died when you were young. Your family lost its money. You've had to work harder than some of these other students just to be here."</p>
                <p>Nikos looked at him, surprised. He hadn't thought Epictetus knew any of that.</p>

                <p>The old philosopher shifted his weight, leaning more heavily on his stick. His leg was bothering him today. Nikos could tell.</p>
                <p>"But Nikos—the stone is carved already. It's behind you. What's in front of you is fresh marble. And every day you make a hundred small cuts. How you spend your evenings. Whether you ask for help. Which paths you take when you're in a hurry."</p>

                <p>Epictetus was quiet for a moment. A breeze moved through the courtyard, rustling the leaves of the olive tree in the corner.</p>
                <p>"Some mornings, I do feel bitter. I'm not made of marble myself. I wake up and my leg aches and I think: this isn't fair. I didn't deserve what happened to me."</p>

            <h1>End Note</h1>
            <p>Epictetus was born around 50 AD in Hierapolis (modern-day Turkey). He spent his early years as a slave in Rome. His leg was permanently injured—some accounts say his master broke it; others say it was a childhood illness.</p>
            <p>After gaining his freedom, he studied Stoic philosophy and eventually founded a school in Nicopolis, Greece, where he taught for decades.</p>
            <p>His core teaching was simple: <em>Some things are in our power, and some things are not.</em> Our task is to recognize the difference—and to give our full attention to what we can actually control.</p>
            <p class="quote">"Don't demand that things happen as you wish, but wish that they happen as they do happen, and you will go on well."</p>
